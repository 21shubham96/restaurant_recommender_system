Little disappointing when starters are not hot.\\n\\nFish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.\\nVeg spring rolls were too good.\\nBig surprise for me is Onion rings as starters 🤣😂\\n\\nKadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.\\nChicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.\\n\\nFor the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.\\n\\nSuggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.\\n\\nOverall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.\""

And importantly good quantity!\\nI wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option \\nExtensive...\\nAmbience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!\\nFood! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian )\\nThe good part! Quantity \\nI was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.\\nThe daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(\\nThe breads and raita were decent!\\nThe Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step \\nConclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.\\nWould like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases.

       " \"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.\\nThey're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.\\nThe menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits\\n\\nPanko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks  - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.\\nVeg Lasagna  - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.\\nCrispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.\\nMakhmali Paneer Tikka -\\nCottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler\\nItalian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.\\nCheese and Cheese Pizza  - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.\\n\\nI cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.\\n\\nThe staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!\",\n",

We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & \"Italian\" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.',\n",

And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it.

The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!\\n\\nStarters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg.

The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate ( Hoping you may use it in your resume).

I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.\\n\\nDesserts ahhahahhhaa!!!\\nYou have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!\\n\\nThe ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch.

The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.\\nThe place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters.

Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.\\n\\nStarters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.\\nMain course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries.

Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.\\nThe staff here is courteous and friendly as well.\\nOverall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues.',\n",

The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience.

We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.\\n\\nAmbiance\\n\\n=========\\n\\nIts a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.\\n\\nService\\n\\n=========\\n\\nThe waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.\\n\\nFood\\n\\n=========\\n\\nHere comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended \"Family Pack\" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the \"Family Pack\" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.\\n\\nValue for Money\\n\\n============\\n\\nAll these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.\\n\\nLets calculate,\\n\\nRating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\n=============\\n\\nIf you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must!

The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.\\n\\nVeg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn’t chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce.

The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you\\'ve booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said \"Outdoor seating cannot be reserved\". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.\\n\\nFinally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.\\n\\nAmbience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.\\n\\nDrinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.\\n\\nFood: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have \"as per size\" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.\\n\\nNow comes the worst zomato gold experience.\\n\\nBefore ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).\\n\\nThe guy who served us didn\\'t come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because \"as per size\" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!\\n\\nThis was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.\\n\\nWe had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.\\n\\nLater ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.\\n\\nIf potion size and value for money is what you\\'re looking for then this olace is not for you. If you\\'re a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.\\n\\nPeace',\n",
       " \"Went here while I was on my trip to Hyderabad, the place is really huge.\\nBest things about this place: food, variety of drinks, dessert and fish.\\nPrice Wise it's expensive, food quantity is great.\\nWe're a bit late, but still they arranged proper food for us.\",\n",

Accompanied with butter naan.\\n\\nThe nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. \\n\\nOverall, the dishes were a must try.

The look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise. This place is for friends, family and your loved ones. They have good variety of appetisers.

       " 'Review :\\n\\nRecently we\\'ve received an invitation from Hyper Local. It\\'s on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:\\n\\nFull Bar\\n\\nNightlife\\n\\nLive Music\\n\\nPrivate Dining Area Available\\n\\nWi-Fi\\n\\nLive Sports Screening\\n\\nIndoor Seating\\n\\nSmoking Area\\n\\nBuffet\\n\\nIf you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.\\n\\nThey are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.\\n\\nAnyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.\\n\\nThe mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.\\n\\nAfter that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can\\'t get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.\\n\\nNow it\\'s time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.\\n\\nThe stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.\\n\\nNow you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means \"spices\" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that\\'s why the 3 different types of dips were served.\\n\\nI felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.\\n\\nAlready written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5\\n\\nLocation is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5\\n\\nService was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5\\n\\nAs per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.',\n",
       " 'They have worst north indian food i believe. Spoiled my birthday mood since i am punjabi and ordered north indian food. But other than that chinese and continental was good. Their safe sex on beach deink is great just.',\n",
       " 'Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are \"fancier than you are\". \\n\\nI ordered for  Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick  in first sip itself. The   peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and  mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread  .\\n\\nIt was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts.',\n",

       " 'Oh my God, what a horrible place. They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I\\'ve no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.\\n\\nAll this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!\\n\\nAgain that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- \"because its the highest priced drink!!\" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!\\n\\nDuring all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.\\n\\nBe aware people. Avoid this place.',\n",
       " \"The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too.\\nThe ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.\\nMoving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ₹ 799.\\nThey had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food.\\nThe drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.\\n\\nThe buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.\\n\\nGolgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down.\\nThe bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.\\nChole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.\\nThe red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation.\\nNoodles were randomly kept with no gravy.\\nThe chicken tikka pockets were dry.\\nThe chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.\\nOverall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.\\nThe music was extremely loud for the place.\\nOverall we had a below average Experience.\\n\\nBased on the drunch menu I would rate it 2.5/5\",\n",

The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.\\n\\nMy experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.\\n\\nSpeaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.\\n\\nThe best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.\\n\\nAll in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes.

       "\"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.Desserts are ice cream and jamun.The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.Veg spring rolls were too good.Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.\""
